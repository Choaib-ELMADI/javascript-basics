1. Object Oriented Programming:
    - Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm centered around objects rather than functions.

2. 4 Pillars of OOP:
    * Encapsulation: Group related variables(properties) and functions(methods) into an object.
    * Abstraction: We can hide some or all the object members. We dont care what's happening inside.
    * Inheritance: Inherite properties and methods.
    * Polymorphism: (Many Forms) Refactor ugly switch/case statements.

3. Classical vs Prototypical Inheritance:
                (Shape is the Prototype of Circle)
                -----------------
        ------> :     Shape      :
        |       -----------------
        |         Commun methods
        |
        |
-----------------
:     Circle     :
-----------------

    * A Prototype is issentially a parent of another object.
