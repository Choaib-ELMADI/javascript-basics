1. Modules:
    * In reel world applications, we split our code into multiple files.
    * Each file is called a module.
    * Benefits:
        > Increase maintainability
        > Reuse Modules
        > Abstraction

2. CommonJS Modules:
    * In CommonJS, before ECMAScript, we use module.exports = { ... } to export things
    * and const name = require("./relative-path") to import them

3. ES6 Tooling:
    * Transpiler = Translator + Compiler
    -> Transpiler translate modern JavaScript code to ES5 code
    Example: BABEL

    * Bundler:
    -> Bundler combines all our JavaScript files into a single file called <- bundle ->
    Example: WEBPACK
